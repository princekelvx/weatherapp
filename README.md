## Weather App

Built with React, styled with TailwindCSS and Powered by OpenWeatherMap API

### New Features

Now includes a "Current Location" button for retrieving weather input without having to search manually.

### How to Use

Input your City, and optionally the your country represented by two letters. GB for Great Britain, US for the United States, NG for Nigeria etc and click the search button and your weather data should appear to you in the metric system of course!

Might work on adding a toggle feature between the Metric and Imperial Systems.
